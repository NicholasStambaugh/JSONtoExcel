# JSONtoExcel


# Explanation

This code is a Python script that converts JSON data into a CSV file. The JSON data is represented by a Python dictionary called json_data, which contains information about responses to a survey.

The script creates a list of dictionaries called response_list, where each dictionary in the list represents a single response to the survey. The dictionary keys are the names of the survey questions, and the values are the corresponding answers.

The script then writes the response_list to a CSV file called responses.csv. The CSV file contains a row for each response, and each column represents a survey question.

# To Use

To use this code, you need to modify the json_data dictionary to contain the responses you want to convert to a CSV file. You should also update the csv_fields list to include the names of all the survey questions in your json_data dictionary.

After making these changes, you can run the script to generate a CSV file containing the responses. The CSV file will be created in the same directory as the script.

Note that this code uses the csv module from the Python standard library, which must be installed to run the script.
